<p><strong>5 With whom we share your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell or rent any of the Personal Data we collect about you to third parties.</p>
<p>We do not disclose any Personal Data about you to third parties, except: (i) as permitted or required by law or regulation or pursuant to any legal process; (ii) in response to governmental, regulatory, law enforcement or judicial inquiries; (iii) to affiliates; (iv) to third party suppliers and service providers (including vendors providing hosting, database management and development services related to the operation of the Website, outsourcing providers of our back-office and internal functions, technology service providers, and/or email marketing services related to events we are hosting, our publications or other communications we may send to you); (v) with other members of our alumni network, with your consent, via our alumni directory; (vi) our lawyers, auditors and other professional advisors; and (vii) entities to whom we may transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets in a restructuring or in connection with a corporate transaction.  If a change happens to our business, then the successor entity may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Within the last twelve (12) months, we have shared with affiliates and service providers each of the categories of Personal Data collected in connection with the Website with affiliates and service providers that are set forth above in Section 2 (&ldquo;Information collected&rdquo;).  Please contact us using the details in Section 14 (&ldquo;Contact&rdquo;) of this Privacy Policy for more details on the third parties with whom we share your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>6 Transfer of Personal Data Under the GDPR</strong><br />
<br />
The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") where a third party identified in Section 5 (&ldquo;With whom we share your Personal Data&rdquo;) is located outside of the EEA.  Where such transfers take place, they are made in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.  Usually, any such transfer will be made on the basis of the model clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers from EU controllers to non-EU controllers, which may be found at the European Commission's website at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915.  For more information about the safeguards we rely on to make such transfers, please use the contact details in Section 14 (&ldquo;Contact&rdquo;) of this Privacy Policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>7 Links to third party websites</strong></p>
<p>We may provide links to third party websites for your information or convenience.  Such websites are independently operated and are not under our control, and the privacy practices of such third party websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy.  We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third party websites or any products or services offered through them or the confidentiality, use, processing and security of any Personal Data that you provide to such websites.</p>
<p><strong>8 Data subject rights under European data protection legislation</strong></p>
<p>This Section 8 is relevant to you to the extent that your Personal Data is protected by the GDPR or equivalent European data protection legislation.  For the purposes of applicable data protection laws in the European Economic Area, including the GDPR, each Kirkland entity will be a data controller of any Personal Data collected by us.  In simple terms, this means that we: (i) &ldquo;control&rdquo; your personal data, including making sure that it is kept secure; and (ii) make certain decisions on how to use and protect your Personal Data, but only to the extent that we have informed you about the use or such use is otherwise permitted by law.  If this paragraph applies to you and you have any questions regarding our use of your Personal Data, or this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact details in Section 14 (&ldquo;Contact&rdquo;) of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Categories of Personal Data</span>: We may collect special categories of Personal Data about you for which we act as a data controller when we collect Personal Data in this manner.  Special categories of Personal Data may include certain demographic information about you such as race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.  For example, we may collect information about your race, ethnicity and sexual orientation when you apply for a job with us if you choose to disclose such information.  We may also collect information about prior criminal convictions and offences in connection with your application for employment with Kirkland, and other special categories of Personal Data as part of background checks that we conduct on job applicants and/or clients and as part of providing services on behalf of our clients.  If you provide us with, or we collect, any special categories of Personal Data, or criminal conviction data, on yourself, we will separately ask you for consent before we agree to the processing of such Personal Data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automated Decision-Making</span>: No automated decision-making, including profiling, is used when processing your Personal Data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Retention</span>: We will retain your Personal Data only for so long as we need the Personal Data for the purposes it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required under applicable law or requested by you.  To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Personal Data Rights</span>: To the extent that your Personal Data is protected by the GDPR or equivalent European data protection legislation, you have the right to access the Personal Data we hold about you, and there are a number of ways you can control the way in which we store such Personal Data.  We have explained these individual rights below.  To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact details in Section 14 (&ldquo;Contact&rdquo;) of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access</span>: You have the right to ask for a copy of the Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge, however we may charge a &ldquo;reasonable fee&rdquo; if we think that your request is excessive, to help us cover the costs of locating the Personal Data you have requested. We will respond to your request as soon as possible and (save for in certain circumstances) within one month.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correction</span>: If there are any inaccuracies in the Personal Data we hold about you, please contact us and we will correct them. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deletion</span>: If you think that we should not be processing your Personal Data any more, you may request that we delete it.  Please note that this may not always be possible due to legal obligations. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Restrictions on use</span>: You may request that we restrict our processing of your Personal Data (other than storing it), if: (i) you contest the accuracy of it (unless the accuracy is verified); (ii) you believe the processing is against applicable law; (iii) you believe that we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was collected (and so may otherwise amend or delete your Personal Data), but you still need your data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or (iv) you have objected to the processing (as set forth in the bullet immediately below) and we are verifying whether our legitimate grounds to process your Personal Data override your own rights.  In such circumstances, we will only process such Personal Data based on your consent (including not deleting it).  However, in certain situations, we may override this right to restriction, either with your consent, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, to protect the rights of others, or for public interests purposes.  We will inform you where such exemption applies or where the restriction is no longer available.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Object</span>: You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.  In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Data which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request the transfer</span>: If you wish to transfer your Personal Data to another organization (and certain conditions are satisfied), you may ask us to do so, and we will send it directly if we have the technical means.  Please note that this right only applies to automated Personal Data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the Personal Data to perform a contract with you.</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Withdrawal of consent</span>: If you previously gave us your consent to allow us to process your Personal Data for a particular purpose, but you no longer wish to consent to us doing so, you can contact us to let us know that you withdraw that consent.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.  If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complaints to Supervisory Authorities</span>: You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the competent data protection supervisory authority in your jurisdiction if you do not agree with the manner in which we have processed your Personal Data or responded to your requests in relation to your Personal Data.  If you are based in: (i) the United Kingdom, this authority if the UK Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (https://ico.org.uk/); (ii) Germany, this authority is Der Bundesbeauftragte f&uuml;r den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit (http://www.bfdi.bund.de/); and (iii) France, this authority is Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert&eacute;s (http://www.cnil.fr/).  We always appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach any such authority so please contact us in the first instance using the contacts in Section 14 (&ldquo;Contact&rdquo;). </p>
